# OpenTelemetry Hello World

This repository is intended to be used to demonstrate some of the capabilities of the OpenTelemetry collector.

Before following the instructions below you must install the following prerequisites:

- kind
- docker
- helm
- kubectl

## Set-up

To set up the demo run:
```
./set-up.sh
```

This script carries out the following steps:

- Creates a local kind cluster called `otel-hello-world`
- Starts `cloud-controller-manager` as a container process. This will automatically set up port forwarding to the grafana service.
- Installs the `observability` helm chart in the `observability` namespace. This installs the following subcharts:
    - OpenTelemetry Operator - this will be used to manage collector instances
    - Prometheus - this will be used as the grafana data source and will be the service the OpenTelemetry collector will send data to
    - Grafana - this will expose an endpoint through which you will be able to access a grafana dashboard and view the collected metrics
- Waits for the pods to be in a running state and outputs the URL to access the grafana dashboard

Run 
```
kubectl get all -n observability
``` 

You should see a similar output to this:

Follow the URL given in the set-up scripts output to access the grafana dashboard. The username is `admin` and the password is `password123`.

Once logged in, navigate to Connections > Data sources and you should see the following:

The default Prometheus data source should already be set-up for you.

From this page click Explore next to the Prometheus data source. You should see the following:

If you click on the Select metric dropdown, you will see there are no metrics available.

In the next section, we will see this dropdown populated by installing a dummy app on the cluster and then create a OpenTelemetry collector to collect metrics from it.

This concludes the set-up steps.
